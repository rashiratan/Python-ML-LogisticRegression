# Python-ML-LogisticRegression

This is a repository for the Logistic Regression for Banknote Authentication project for my ISM4641-Python for Business Analytics class.

This assignment aims to demonstrate my ability to apply binary logistic regression to a real-world dataset containing only continuous features. I will practice loading data, preparing it for modeling, training a logistic regression model, interpreting its results, evaluating its performance using accuracy, and drawing basic conclusions.
